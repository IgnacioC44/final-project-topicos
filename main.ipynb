If the tomatoes are on their vines, pull them off. The green stalky bits should come \\noff at the same time, but if they don’t, just pull or twist \\nthem off afterwards. Throw the vines and green bits \\naway and wash the tomatoes. Now cut each tomato into quarters and slice off any hard cores (they don’t soften during cooking and you’d get hard bits in the \\nsoup at the end).

Still with the heat low, cook the vegetables until they’re soft and faintly coloured.

Stir to mix everything together, put the lid on the pan and let the tomatoes stew over a low heat for 10 mins until they shrink down in the pan and their juices flow nicely. From time to time, give the pan a good shake – this will keep everything well mixed.\\n4 Slowly pour in the hot stock, stirring at the same \\ntime to mix it with the vegetables. Turn up the heat as high as it will go and wait until everything is bubbling, then turn the heat down to low again and put the lid back on the pan.

Infact they have a healthy meal twice a day under the healthy program of the primary school. They are also pretty much involved in the cooking process of their dinner. However, their cooking ingredients come from a commercial supermarket. This does not allow them to investigate their food further as much as they would like to.\\nAs students and makers of this little book, we', 'As students and makers of this little book, we \\nwere deeply inspired by the dedication and ex-citement of the kids, their creativity and freedom of imagination. They showed us a path that leads to a healthier Grangetown, more aware of  the quality of its local products and more motivated to rediscover natural and genuine flavours. There is potential to propose a space that provides a deeper understanding of food as part of the environment. Food as the centre of a community, food as the focus of a place where everybody comes together to share, learn and enjoy every-day life.recipe book - CONCLUSION\\npage 58\\n“It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver”,  \\nMahatma Gandhi1000 Recipes 001-004 CapInd.qxd  31/1/08  15:20  Page 1\\n       FD2F304A-A86F-4EF6-A7C3-6725B7FAD0831000 Recipes 001-004 CapInd.qxd  31/1/08  15:20  Page 2\\n       FD2F304A-A86F-4EF6-A7C3-6725B7FAD0831000 Recipes 001-004 CapInd.qxd  31/1/08  15:20  Page 3', 'FD2F304A-A86F-4EF6-A7C3-6725B7FAD0831000 Recipes 001-004 CapInd.qxd  31/1/08  15:20  Page 2\\n       FD2F304A-A86F-4EF6-A7C3-6725B7FAD0831000 Recipes 001-004 CapInd.qxd  31/1/08  15:20  Page 3\\n       FD2F304A-A86F-4EF6-A7C3-6725B7FAD083This edition published in 2008 by Arcturus Publishing Limited \\n26/27 Bickels Yard, 151–153 Bermondsey Street, London SE1 3HA\\nIn Canada published for Indigo Books\\n468 King St W, Suite 500,Toronto, Ontario M5V 1L8\\nCopyright © 2008 Arcturus Publishing LimitedAll rights reserved. \\nNo part of this publication may be reproduced, stored in aretrieval system, or transmitted, in any form or by any means,electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or otherwise,without written permission in accordance with the provisions ofthe Copyright Act 1956 (as amended).
